## ðŸ§¬ Background

CRISPR spacer sequences recovered from metagenomic datasets can provide insights into host-virus interactions, microbial immunity, and microbial community dynamics in ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats. This project focuses on generating a curated database of CRISPR spacers from the rumen and intestinal microbiomes of ruminants.
